// IMPORTANT POINTS //

reference: https://hackmd.io/@ironaddicteddog/solana-anchor-escrow

//initialize instruction is basically like staking. Put your token into a vault (stake)
//cancel instruction is to tell the program to end your staking. so it will return back the token staked and close the vault which was used for staking.
//exchange instruction is to swap 2 tokens. from A to taker to vault to taker to B.
